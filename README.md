RAPD has been used as a powerful genotyping tool. 
It utilizes short oligonucleotide as primer that binds ambiguously to 
multiple sites on a genome. The amplified fragments may exhibit 
distinctive pattern on gel contributed by the polymorphic DNA regions 
present in the genome of the organism. Selection of the random primer 
requires actual laboratory experiments, starting from a panel of 
oligonucletides. It is totally a blind experiment. This procedure can 
be time-consuming and require several runs to identify a suitable one.
